Parsing Elixir's AST
--------------------

This is my first attempt at manually parsing Elixir's AST in order to produce an usable dataset for an Elixir linter.

It's very rough and not in a usable state, but if you want to run the tests locally, clone the repo and then run:

```
mix deps.get && mix test
```
